                Throughout this semester, I was involved in an innovative project alongside Franck Bourzat, Krishna Sujan Inuganti, Yuheng Jin, Ismail Touzani and Théo Zanchi. Our project aims to give people the opportunity to access and know information about the quality of their surrounding environment. This goal was achieved by building a device and a platform able to monitor pollution parameters at a specific location.

                  The principle of OneM2M is to offer a global standard for machine to machine and the Internet of Things. The objective of this association is to simplify the implementation of complex IoT networks integrating many devices. It is an open standard that offers a fairly generic and horizontal vision of connected systems. This responds to the need for a common service layer in the machine-to-machine domain, regardless of hardware or software. Thus with its standardized interface, OneM2M makes it possible to disregard the underlying protocols. This common layer tends to integrate different applications requiring for example their own communication protocols. This standard can be applied to a wide variety of sectors ranging from connected homes, e-health, intelligent transport and industrial automation.

                  OM2M is the Eclipse software dedicated to the deployment and implementation of the OneM2M standard. It is open-source software originally developed by LAAS-CNRS. At the beginning of the labs, we learned how to configure and launch the OM2M platform and how to manage the resource tree with the OM2M interface.During the labs, we were able to interact with objects and visualize the data sent by them. We used a java application launched on the user's computer to simulate lamps. You will find the ressource tree associated to the lamps in the following figure.

                  To manipulate resources I used a REST API. And I used Postman to easily send requests.

                  For the final project, we used Node-Red. It is an open-source visual editor from IBM for the Internet of Things. It makes it easy to link data sources to processing components, local or remote, and to create value chains with a few clicks. When the Node-Red program is deployed the operations are translated into http requests and sent to the MN-CSE to be translated into the technology of the device.

                  In the final project, we have created an application which turns lamp 1 OFF, when the lamp 0 is  ON and the brightness is above a certain threshold (here 200 lux). When the brightness is below this threshold, the lamp 1 is turned ON. You will find our Node-Red wireframe in the following figure.

                  In this course, I studied SOA and ROA concepts. Nowadays, those concepts are essential in software engineering and very useful to build highly scalable, complex and modular applications. Service-oriented architecture is here to provide solutions to application integration problems. In order to expose the different functionalities of one or more services, the SOA encapsulates the applications in the form of software bricks called services. Unlike SOA (oriented at services), ROA (oriented at resources) will do more of its processing internally.

                  During the lab sessions I was able to put in practice all the knowledge acquired during the course. I created SOAP web services from a java class, following the bottom-up and top-down approach. I also implemented a client for the SOAP web service. An other lab session consisted in the creation, deployment and testing of a BPEL procedure orchestrating three web services. I also created a Rest web service and a client of this same service where the client would consume and produce data in JSON or XML format. In the final lab I used the Spring Boot framework to create three micro-services communicating and collaborating together.

                  In my final project, I deployed a RESTful architecture for a running competition. With Arnaud Guiller, we created the micro-services architecture in pairs and implemented two micro-services individually. We used the Maven management tool and the Spring Boot framework to create our numerous micro-services and we tested our implementation with Postman. You will find more details on this project in the report below.

                  Cloud computing delivers computing services over the Internet to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. It is harnessing the power of remote servers. Resources are pooled among several clients, which allows them to access “unlimited” resources remotely, without having to modify their local architecture. The cloud relies on machine virtualization and remote servers that adapt to the computing power needed. It is a huge step towards scalability and automatic adaptation of the load. There are several levels of cloud services, IaaS (the client manages from the OS of a VM), PaaS (the client controls a development environment), SaaS (the client controls only the data).

                  During the first lab, I discovered different virtualization techniques and how to use them. I configured a local virtual machine with VirtualBox. The general purpose of this lab was to enhance our knowledge of virtualization techniques, concepts and technologies.

                  In the final lab, I got a good understanding of the service-based application lifecycle management in cloud computing context. I studied the several provisioning process phases and investigated the way they should be implemented when provisioning. I discovered several “PaaS” cloud platforms and deployed a web applications.

                  Throughout this course we studied various technologies used in the internet of things. More and more present in our daily lives, connected objects help us to better manage our home, travels or health and facilitate digital transformation of companies. Technologies vary depending on the type of devices. To name only a few of the famous technologies, we have GSM, Wifi, ZigBee, Bluetooth. However, the world of IoT faces many challenges such as energy efficiency, security or deployment.

                  I studied the BLE technology, formerly known as Bluetooth Smart. This improvement of the standard Bluetooth appeared with version 4.0. It provides a service with greatly reduced energy consumption and cost, while maintaining the same coverage. It only works with recent devices because it is not backward compatible. The energy saving of this protocol comes largely from its possibility of being disconnected, that is to say that the devices are aware of each other and only connects when necessary, and as quickly as possible.

                  Throughout this semester I was involved in an innovative project alongside Franck Bourzat, Krishna Sujan Inuganti, Yuheng Jin, Ismail Touzani and Théo Zanchi. Our project aims to give people the opportunity to access and know information about the quality of their surrounding environment. This goal was achieved by building a device and a platform able to monitor pollution parameters at a specific location.

                  Our project is called "Social Network for Pollution" and our ambition is to distribute our solution to a large number of person. By displaying air quality measures on a map we want to create a social network around pollution monitoring. We broken down the project development in five different sections and I mainly worked on the business part. You will find the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) of the project in the following figure.

I also created a pricing model, studied the acceptability of our solution and analyzed the potential fundings.  In the following figures, you will find explanatory diagrams on the positioning, the pricing model and the business model canvas.

                  <strong>Solution: </strong>
                  Our solution is composed of 4 different parts:
                  <ul class="text-left p-0 mb-0 ml-4">
                    <li>Device: A platform (LoPy4 board) is interconnected with the GPS receiver, some gas sensors: CO, O3, SO2, NO2 and more common sensors like temperature, humidity and pressure.</li>
                    <li>Transport: The platform sends the measures via the LoRa protocol to a worldwide LoRaWAN shared network.</li>
                    <li>Computation and storage: It is composed of an OM2M server which implements the TTN IPE and runs along a NodeJs server.</li>
                    <li>Visualisation: It is a mobile application. It fetches the data from the NodeJs server and displays them as a map.</li>
                  </ul>
                  You will find the general architecture of the project in the following figure.

                  We decided to monitor pollution by collecting data on the following parameters: Temperature, Pressure, Fine particles, Carbon monoxide, Ozone, Nitrogen dioxide and Sulphur dioxide. You will find the acquisition architecture (both high level and low level) in the following figures.

                  <strong>Transport: </strong>
                  We needed to find a low energy protocol for our solution. LoRaWAN was a great choice. This MAC protocol allows long range wireless communication for battery powered devices. It covers both the second and third layer of the OSI model, which ease the creation of multi-devices networks. The Thing Network (TTN) is the biggest open shared LoRaWAN network and it was a great solution to implement the air quality monitoring platform. You will find a typical architecture of LoRaWAN network in the following figure.

                  <strong>Computation: </strong>
                  We used an OM2M server to store and organize the data in our project. This open source software is the Eclipse implementation of the OneM2M standard. This standard has a transversal position that gives it a high degree of interoperability, adaptability and scalability with discovery and integration mechanisms.

                  We chose to implement a noSQL MongoDB database for the user database because of the lightweight, simplicity and scalability. We implemented a REST API to make the transition between the OM2M server and the user applications. You will find a sequence diagram of the interactions between the OM2M server, the Node.js API and the user application in the following figure .

                  <strong>Visualisation: </strong>
                  We chose React-Native to develop our mobil application. Unlike other crossplatform frameworks, React-Native provides native-like application performances and has numerous libraries and APIs.
                  <p class="mt-4">In the end, we successfully delivered a functional prototype of the platform and the application. Check out the final report to see our full project. </p>

                In december, I participated in a 48 hours hackathon organised by Sierra Wireless and INSA Toulouse, on the future of connected mobility applied to IoT applications and services.

                The project we developped is called "SafeDrive". It is a car accident detector combining an IoT device and a mobil application.

                During the hackathon we were able to realise a prototype that could detect car accidents and automatically alert emergency services. The prototype was based on the MangOH card. We were able to use the built-in accelerometer to detect the collisions. When an accident was detected, we would send an SMS via a SIM card inserted in the MangOH. The SMS would contain various informations about:
                <ul class="text-left">
                  <li>the location (GPS coordinates and a google maps link)</li>
                  <li>the time of the accident</li>
                  <li>the driver's medical information (blood group, body size ...)</li>
                </ul>
                We printed a model of the car at the Fablab, in laser-cut wood. We also made an interactive mockup of the user mobile application using Adobe XD.
                <br>
                I mainly worked on the mobile application prototype, the business plan and the final presentation.

                <p>I am currently a member of the Do It Ocracy  incubator at the IoT Valley. I am working on a startup project called "Billi" with my partner Delphine Thoral. Driven by our common values, our project was born in september. With Billi, we want to make a positive impact on everyday business expenses and bring them towards more eco-responsibility in the office. </p>

                The incubator supports us on all the stages of our startup creation. We benefit from daily mentorship, numerous training and various experiences as well as a quality network. This daily immersion in a vibrant ecosystem, allows us to develop the many skills essential to the entrepreneur. This support allowed us to quickly develop our project and was crucial on key stages such as the ideation phase, the validation of the market and the target, the launch of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)... </p>

                You will find more information on the following reports. In the first report I describe the project, show its progress and present our ambitions. In the second report I detail the development process of our final solution: a peer-to-peer e-commerce platform.</p>

                During my internship, I joined the local team of project leaders, architects and designers, and worked with remote development teams from Bangladesh and India. We conducted our projects using various collaborative tools and agile methods.

                I worked on two main projects. One project was the development of a crossplatform app for a Norwegian IoT product. I realized the entire design (using Adobe XD) and the frontend development part. For the backend side, I worked hand in hand with remote development partners. I developed the application using the Ionic4 framework with Angular and TypeScript.

                The other project was a machine-learning research project aiming to understand the client (a large multinational company) and their needs, and thus optimize the offer and pricing in the market. For this python project, I used various libraries like Pandas for the data preprocessing and TensorFlow or SciKit for the machine learning algorithms. I used Plotly and Power BI to display the various datasets and results.

                In the end, for the first project, we delivered a functional crossplatform app to the client.  And for the second project, I highlighted interesting insights from the data. Overall, it was a valuable and rewarding international experience. A great adventure !

          <p class="text-faded mb-4">
            This semester was dense and rich in experiences. The ISS formation allowed me to acquire a lot of skills in the field of IoT and various competencies in both hardware and software. I am confident that I now have the right skills, knowledge and mindset to conduct the develoment of an innovative IT product or service.
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded mb-4">
            I am really grateful that I got the opportunity to join the IoT Valley incubator. It was a rewarding experience and I am proud of my project.
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded mb-4">
            This semester was quite challenging. I had to balance between my startup project and the ISS formation. It was hard to find the right balance. For some projects, I haven't been able to get involved as much as I wanted to. As I had to develop my own startup project and follow the ISS formation remotly, I would say that self training and autonomy were the cornerstone of this semester.
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded mb-4">
            Overall, I am more than satisfied with the steps I carried out and the level of expertise I reached throughout this semester.
          </p>
          <h4 class="mb-4 text-colored">Balance Sheet</h4>
          <p class="text-faded mb-4">The development of this portfolio was extremely interesting. I was able to visualize the depth and the diversity of the skills I developed. I really like this evaluation format. It allows you to take a step back and have a good overview of the overall semester. This portfolio is a faithful representation of the competences I have acquired and a great tool on which I can rely to present the extend of my skills.
          </p>
          <h4 class="mb-4 text-colored">Complementary Elements</h4>
          <p class="text-faded mb-4">I find that the technical part of the portfolio often repeats what has already been said in the reports. I don’t know if it is very relevant to develop the technical aspects twice. Therefore, to avoid the portfolio from being too heavy and repetitive, I sometimes chose not to develop all the technical details.
